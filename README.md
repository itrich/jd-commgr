# Preface

[Sovereign Cloud Stack (SCS)](https://scs.community) is a network of existing and future providers of standardized sovereign cloud and container infrastructure to join forces in defining, implementing and operating a fully open, federated, compatible platform. By joining forces, the platform can support a healthy ecosystem for service and application developers and strengthen the digitalization efforts in Europe without creating large risks to lose control over the technology and the data. Since July 2021, SCS has been granted funding from the [German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action](https://scs.community) and is hosted by the [Open Source Business Alliance e.V. (OSBA)](https://osb-alliance.com).

A community of employees from participating and interested companies are regularly contributing towards the joint mission of SCS. Additionally, the OSBA is building a team that manages and coordinates standardization, software integration and the development of this network. 

 This document describes the upstream community we're striving for and how the dedicated role of a community manager can significantly contribute to this goal. The community manager of SCS takes responsibility to foster a thriving upstream community and empowers as well as motivates individuals to (technically) contribute to the project. 

# The community and culture we're striving for

The SCS project is striving for a self-organized and motivated community, that can contribute without being blocked or having to ask for permission. We're following the fundamental principle *people over processes over tools*[^PPT] and align our actions accordingly.

By providing the proper processes (and thus the needed toolset) that are defined by the community, the barrier to engage is significantly lowered.

# Mission statement of the community manager

The key performance indicators of the community manager can be

- Keep people interested
